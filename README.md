# Text-Classification-with-TensorFlow-in-Machine-Learning
This project implements a text classification model using TensorFlow and TensorFlow Hub to perform sentiment analysis on the IMDB movie reviews dataset. The model utilizes a pre-trained word embedding from TensorFlow Hub and a neural network architecture to classify movie reviews as positive or negative based on their textual content.
